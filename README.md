# Supplementary Material for MICCAI 2023 accepted paper: Inflated 3D Convolution-Transformer for Weakly-supervised Carotid Stenosis Grading with Ultrasound Videos
__Supplemental Table 1.__ Architecture of CSG-3DCT, where each stage (c₁-c₅) mainly includes a 3D Conv (mark in blue) and AMDF Trans (mark in red) blocks, except 3D Conv Sub-block in c₁. Residual connections are performed
in all 3D Conv Sub-blocks. Kernels are denoted by {_T_ × _S_{²}, _C_}
